## Red Team Submission Update
If you're grading us as a red team and want to see our initial (before Wed.) submission: We improved the website more after the final, as we wanted to fix a few design problems and add a new LLM-analyzer feature. 
If you want to access the code we used for our initial submission, please look at commit #716a5b5

## Organization
Most of the code and data can be found in the special_participation_site folder. thread_util was used for initial post extraction and is not strictly needed for the website.
It is only to update the posts on the website.
